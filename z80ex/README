!!IMPORTANT!!

!!THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL Z80EX!! PLEASE READ FURTHER ...

This is a somewhat modified and stripped down version of Z80Ex
used for CPU emulation in my GNU/GPL project. Thus, if you want
Z80Ex for your project, you should use the original version.
Z80Ex in this form within this project may be not useful for you
in your oen project.

Modifications compared to the original source distribution:

* no Makefile, etc: my project uses it directly

* no perl code, and data tables to generate the C code,
  I use and modified the generated code only (I know, ugly solution)

* Z180 emulation: only a rough emulation: timing is still Z80,
  no on-chip features, no MMU, only about the opcodes which are
  invalid on Z180 (like IXL/IXH/IYL/IYH related), and some of the
  new Z180 opcodes, z80/z180 mode can be switched at run-time


Now back to the original README, thanks for your patience:

Z80Ex

ZiLOG Z80 CPU emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features:
---------

- precise opcode emulation (documented & undocumented)
- exact timings for each opcode (including I/O operations)
- full support for all interrupt modes
- any number of virtual CPUs may be created
- portable: written in pure ANSI C
- builds as a library with simple callback-based API
- disassembler included  


Building and installing:
--------------------------------------------------------

to build and install using CMake build system, refer to INSTALL.cmake
to build and install using GNU Make, refer to INSTALL.gmake


Usage intro:
------------

emulator:

include <z80ex/z80ex.h> in your sources,
link with "libz80ex" (-lz80ex).

for (rather subtle) API documentation see "z80ex.h".

disassembler:

include <z80ex/z80ex_dasm.h> in your sources,
link with "libz80ex_dasm" (-lz80ex_dasm).

for API documentation see "z80ex_dasm.h".
also you may look at "dasm.c" from the "examples" directory
