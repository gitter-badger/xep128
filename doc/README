This directory contains more-or-less random documentations, sources of
programs, etc I found and find useful to develop Xep128.

Some of the texts, programs are written by me, some of them are not!
There is no single copyright/etc on files in this directory, this
can mean anything ... unless the license is not stated inside the file
itself.

z180test.asm

  z180test is a quirky Z180 behaviour tester written by me for
  Enteprise-128 equipped with Z180 CPU instead of Z80. It's used
  to test the result on my emulator and compared with a real
  EP/Z180 (thanks, Zozo!).
