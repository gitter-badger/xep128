This file contains somewhat "official" releases, and important steps. For
proper ChangeLog, you should have a look on the GIT (github) commit log!

2016/Apr/07 --------------------------------------------------------------

	* FILE: functionality, currently buggy and ugly code, only reading!
	  It's about accessing files directly from host OS FS, much like
	  FILE: in ep128emu.
	  Default directory: files inside the preferences directory.
	  No support for UI based file selection, file name and/or path
	  must be provided. Example:

	  LOAD"FILE:mandel.bas"

	  No support for setting FILE: as the default, so you must use
	  FILE: all the time.

	* XEP/MONITOR commands DIR and CD to show/navigate on the host OS
	  directory tree (what FILE: would use). Output is really ugly,
	  and unsorted. Only files are shown with size under 64K.
	  To show what is the current directory FILE: would use, issue
	  a CD command with :XEP or monitor/console.

	* skiplogo command line switch or configure file option to skip
	  the Enterprise logo (uses XEP ROM which modifies the CRDISP
	  EXOS flag).

	* Ugly 4 colour text mode support (still Nick rewrite is needed!)
	  Bricky Prise seems to work.

	* Joystick support via game controllers and/or joysticks, what
	  SDL can support (the numeric keypad can be still used though).
	  Currently, the first controller found is assigned for axis 0/1
	  and button 0 whatever they are :-/
	  Bricky Prise seems to be playable with X-Box 360 game controller
	  now. Even EPDOS can be :-) However, if your controller/joystick
	  has axis 0/1 at an insane position or not assigned to the same
	  handle, it can be odd. TODO: configuration of used axes/buttons
	  for functions.

	* Monitor/Console/XEP disasm/memory dump, I/O port dump commands.
	  See help command (:XEP help from EP)
